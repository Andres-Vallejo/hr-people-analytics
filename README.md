# HR People Analytics

People analytics project focused on attrition, engagement, tenure, department patterns, and workforce insights.

## Business Questions

- Which departments have elevated attrition?
- How do engagement and tenure relate to attrition?
- Where should HR prioritize interventions?
- What should leaders monitor quarterly?

## Repository Structure

```text
data/                 Sample data for the case study
src/                  Python analysis workflow
sql/                  SQL queries for KPI extraction
reports/              Executive summary and recommendations
outputs/              Generated analysis outputs, ignored by git
requirements.txt      Python dependencies
```

## How To Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/analysis.py
```

The script reads `data/sample_data.csv`, creates KPI summaries, and saves generated outputs in `outputs/`.
